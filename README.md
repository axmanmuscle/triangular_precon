## Triangular Preconditioning
This is a project about puting a nonsymmetric preconditioner onto something like a proximal point method.

## To Do
 - Write up some of the math in this readme
 - list of papers
 - write some code that works

For the code, start with:
 - proximal point (done)
 - then code for our weighted proximal point with only a diagonal matrix (done)
   - check to make sure these match when the matrix is alpha*Identity
 - then when you change the entries
 - then fully triangular
